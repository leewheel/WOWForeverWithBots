-- Classic 1.60 (WoW Forever): the Energizing Vortex (267599) tornadoes on Zephras Isle carry Energizing Winds (1299003, aura 395 =
-- area trigger, create properties 43253). Touching one gives Blessing of Zephras (1258510: run speed +40% for 5 min, ends on
-- hostile action), seen on the player in the official beta sniff (70170); the player casts it on himself
-- (classic_at_energizing_vortex), so leaving the moving trigger does not remove it. The shape is not in the client data: a 5 yd
-- sphere, about the size of the tornado model. Safe to run again.
